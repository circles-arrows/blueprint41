DLR & dynamic interface implementation
--------------------------------------

From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12496837/dynamically-implementing-c-sharp-interfaces-possible-or-not

It is possible dynamically implement an interface in C# without emitting code using reflection, maybe with the help of DLR.
Yes, I would think so. Bill Wagner has an article named Implementing Dynamic Interfaces. It demonstrates how you can use
	IDynamicMetaObjectProvide interface and in particular the DynamicMetaObject class to roll you very own dynamic object.
	However, it is a somewhat complex concept and at some point it will require some reflection to hook up the members of
	the interface to the corresponding DLR representation.
You cannot use an already existing dynamic object like ExpandoObject because the implemented interfaces (actually just one
	interface) cannot be changed dynamically.
